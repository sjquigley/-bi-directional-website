<h2 class="left">Introduction</h2>
<p class="left">The Clemson Ghost Tour is a study of the Clemson ecology, the network of interconnected people, things, spaces, and places, local and global, past and present, those included and excluded, that contribute to our experience of being here at Clemson University.

<p class="left">This Clemson ecology has significant implications for other ecologies and ecosystems in our state and in our posthuman networked super ecology. Indeed, it haunts us.</p>

<p class="left">Scientists tell us we are in an important moment ecologically, we can do increasingly more violence. or bring about the sort of changes that make for a healthy planet. Ecologist tell us that we cannot make these changes without also addressing the social, and our own unethical making. Perhaps this change begins right here, at Clemson University, in our pursuit to make this "high seminary" both just and equitable. This Ghost Tour writes these network spaces, calling on us to attend to our natural and built environment, and thus to the people, things, and ethics that dwell within.</p>
